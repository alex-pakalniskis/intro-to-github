## Important repositories for The Graph

### [`contracts`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts)
Contains the source code for the smart contracts that power the Graph Protocol. The Graph Protocol is an indexing and querying protocol for blockchain data that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on top of various blockchain networks. The smart contracts in this repository define the rules and functionality for interacting with the Graph Protocol, including managing the deployment and incentivization of indexing nodes, the creation and curation of subgraphs, and the querying of indexed data. The code is written in Solidity, the programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

### [`graph-node`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/)
Contains the source code for the Graph Node, a core component of the Graph Protocol. The Graph Node is a high-performance indexing and query engine that enables decentralized applications to efficiently search and retrieve data from various blockchain networks. The code in this repository includes the implementation of the Graph Node's data ingestion pipeline, indexing engine, and GraphQL query processing, as well as various tools for deploying and managing the Graph Node infrastructure. The code is written in Rust, a systems programming language known for its speed and memory safety.

### [`indexer`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer)
Contains the source code for the Graph Indexer Agent, a component of the Graph Protocol that allows developers to run their own indexing nodes and participate in indexing subgraphs. The Indexer Agent is responsible for fetching and indexing data from blockchain networks and storing it in a local database, which can then be queried by the Graph Node. The code in this repository includes the implementation of the Indexer Agent's data ingestion pipeline, indexing engine, and communication with the Graph Node, as well as various tools for deploying and managing the Indexer Agent infrastructure. The code is written in Rust, a systems programming language known for its speed and memory safety.

### [`allocation-optimizer`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/allocation-optimizer)
Contains the source code for the Graph Network Allocation Optimizer, a tool for optimizing the allocation of incentives to Indexers on the Graph Network. The allocation optimizer takes various input parameters such as market conditions, indexing and query performance, and network fees, and uses mathematical optimization algorithms to determine the optimal allocation of incentives to maximize the overall performance and efficiency of the network. The code in this repository includes the implementation of the allocation optimizer algorithm and various tools for data analysis and visualization. The code is written in Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and scientific computing.

### [`graph-tooling`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling)
Contains a collection of developer tools and utilities for working with the Graph Protocol. The tools in this repository include a subgraph deployment CLI, a subgraph migration tool, a subgraph test framework, and various utility scripts for interacting with the Graph Node and Indexer Agent. The code in this repository is intended to simplify the development and deployment process for dApps built on the Graph Protocol by providing a streamlined set of tools and utilities. The code is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds support for static typing and other language features.

### [`graph-client`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client)
Contains a JavaScript/TypeScript client library for interacting with the Graph Protocol's GraphQL API. The client library provides a simple and intuitive interface for querying data from subgraphs deployed on the Graph Network. The code in this repository includes the implementation of the GraphQL query builder and client, as well as various utility functions for interacting with the Graph Node. The code is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds support for static typing and other language features, and is designed to be used in both browser and Node.js environments.

### [`common-ts`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/common-ts)
Contains a collection of TypeScript utility functions and types used across multiple Graph Protocol projects. The code in this repository includes common data structures, type definitions, and utility functions, such as BigInt serialization and deserialization, cryptographic operations, and error handling. The code is designed to be reused across different Graph Protocol projects, improving consistency and reducing duplicated code. The code is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds support for static typing and other language features.

### [`substreams`](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams)
Contains the source code for the Substreams project, a high-performance and scalable indexing and querying system for blockchain data. Substreams is designed to work with the Graph Protocol, providing an alternative to the existing indexing and querying stack by leveraging streaming data processing techniques. The code in this repository includes the implementation of the Substreams data ingestion pipeline, indexing engine, and query processing, as well as various tools for deploying and managing the Substreams infrastructure. The code is written in Rust, a systems programming language known for its speed and memory safety. The Substreams project is developed by StreamingFast, a blockchain data infrastructure provider.

### [`docs`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/docs)
Contains the source files and documentation for the Graph Protocol's official documentation website at https://thegraph.com/docs/. The documentation covers various aspects of the Graph Protocol, including its architecture, smart contracts, data model, and development tools. The documentation is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, and is built using the Sphinx documentation generator. The code in this repository includes the documentation source files, build scripts, and configuration files. The repository also includes a docs-examples folder with various code examples and tutorials.
