### Instructor background

I'm an experienced GitHub user, having started using the platform around 2017. I currently work in the web2 industry, having joined in October 2020. In addition to my professional work, I have been exploring the web3 space and working on projects in this area since April 2022. I use GitHub for both personal and professional source code management and project management. 

### Brief introduction about what GitHub is and its purpose.
GitHub is a web-based platform that is used for version control and collaborative software development. It is a place where developers can store and share their code with others, track changes, and collaborate on projects. GitHub is built on top of Git, which is a version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes to their code over time. GitHub provides a range of features and tools, such as issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools, that make it easier for developers to work together on projects. GitHub is used by millions of developers and organizations around the world, and it has become an essential tool for modern software development.

### How GitHub is widely used and why it's important to learn about it.
GitHub is widely used by software developers, both individual and teams, as a platform for managing and sharing their code. It is used for a wide range of projects, from small personal projects to large-scale enterprise applications. Developers use GitHub to store their code repositories, track changes to their code, collaborate with other developers, and manage issues related to their code. 

Learning about GitHub is important for several reasons. First, it is a valuable tool for developers to learn in order to effectively collaborate on software development projects. Second, it helps developers learn and practice important skills such as version control, code review, and project management. Third, GitHub is a popular platform used by many organizations, and knowing how to use it can be an asset for anyone pursuing a career in software development. Finally, by contributing to open-source projects hosted on GitHub, developers can learn from others, gain recognition, and improve their skills. Overall, learning how to use GitHub is an important step for anyone interested in software development or collaborative project management.

## Understanding GitHub
- Repositories, branches, and commits.
- Version control, code sharing, and collaboration.
- Pull requests and how they facilitate collaboration.

### Repositories, branches, and commits.
#### GitHub Repository:
A repository is a container for a collection of files related to a specific project. Repositories are used to store and organize code, and they allow developers to track changes and collaborate on projects. Think of a repository as a folder that contains all the files related to a project. On GitHub, users can create repositories for their own projects or contribute to repositories owned by others.

#### GitHub Branch:
A branch is a separate version of the code that is being developed or changed. Branches are used to experiment with new features, fix bugs, and work on different versions of the code without affecting the main version of the code. Think of a branch as a separate copy of the repository that can be modified without affecting the original version. Developers create new branches when they want to make changes to the code, and then merge those changes back into the main branch once they are ready.

#### GitHub Commit:
A commit is a saved change made to a repository. It represents a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time. Commits are used to track changes to the code over time, and they allow developers to revert to previous versions of the code if necessary. Think of a commit as a "save" button for changes made to the code. When developers make changes to the code, they commit those changes with a message describing what was changed, why it was changed, and how it was changed.

Overall, GitHub repositories, branches, and commits are important tools used by developers to manage and collaborate on code. By understanding these concepts, non-developers can gain a better understanding of how developers work together and manage code repositories effectively.

### Version control, code sharing, and collaboration.
#### Version Control:
GitHub uses Git, a popular version control system, to keep track of changes made to code over time. Version control allows developers to track changes, make changes to code in separate branches, and merge changes back into the main codebase. This ensures that changes made to the code are tracked and can be undone if necessary.

#### Code Sharing:
GitHub allows developers to share their code with others by creating and sharing repositories. A repository is a container for a collection of files related to a specific project. Developers can use repositories to store and organize their code, and they can share their code with others by making their repositories public. This allows other developers to access and contribute to the code, which can lead to faster development and improved code quality.

#### Collaboration:
GitHub provides a range of tools to help developers collaborate on projects. This includes features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews. Issue tracking allows developers to track bugs, feature requests, and other issues related to their code. Pull requests allow developers to propose changes to code and have those changes reviewed by others before they are merged into the main codebase. Code reviews allow developers to review each other's code and provide feedback, which can improve the quality of the code and help identify potential issues.

Overall, GitHub is a powerful platform for version control, code sharing, and collaboration. By using GitHub, developers can work together more effectively, share their code with others, and improve the quality of their code through collaboration and feedback.

### Pull requests and how they facilitate collaboration.
A pull request is a feature of GitHub that allows developers to propose changes to code and have those changes reviewed by others before they are merged into the main codebase. Pull requests are used to facilitate collaboration and ensure that changes to code are reviewed and approved by other developers.

#### Code Sharing: 
When a developer wants to make changes to code in a repository, they create a new branch and make their changes there. Once the changes are complete, they create a pull request that includes a summary of the changes and a description of why they were made. This allows other developers to see the proposed changes and provide feedback.

#### Code Review: 
Once a pull request is created, other developers can review the changes and provide feedback. They can leave comments on specific lines of code or on the pull request as a whole. This allows for a collaborative review process that can help identify potential issues or improvements.

#### Collaboration: 
Pull requests can facilitate collaboration between developers by allowing them to work together on code changes. For example, if a developer notices a bug while reviewing a pull request, they can create a new branch, fix the bug, and create a new pull request with their changes. This can lead to faster development and improved code quality.

#### Quality Control: 
Pull requests help ensure that changes to code are reviewed and approved by other developers before they are merged into the main codebase. This can help improve the quality of the code and prevent bugs or other issues from being introduced.

Overall, GitHub pull requests facilitate collaboration by allowing developers to share code, review changes, and work together on code improvements. By using pull requests, developers can work together more effectively and ensure that changes to code are reviewed and approved before they are merged into the main codebase.
