### Instructor background

I'm an experienced GitHub user, having started using the platform around 2017. I currently work in the web2 industry, having joined in October 2020. In addition to my professional work, I have been exploring the web3 space and working on projects in this area since April 2022. I use GitHub for both personal and professional source code management and project management. 

### Brief introduction about what GitHub is and its purpose.
GitHub is a web-based platform that is used for version control and collaborative software development. It is a place where developers can store and share their code with others, track changes, and collaborate on projects. GitHub is built on top of Git, which is a version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes to their code over time. GitHub provides a range of features and tools, such as issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools, that make it easier for developers to work together on projects. GitHub is used by millions of developers and organizations around the world, and it has become an essential tool for modern software development.

### How GitHub is widely used and why it's important to learn about it.
GitHub is widely used by software developers, both individual and teams, as a platform for managing and sharing their code. It is used for a wide range of projects, from small personal projects to large-scale enterprise applications. Developers use GitHub to store their code repositories, track changes to their code, collaborate with other developers, and manage issues related to their code. 

Learning about GitHub is important for several reasons. First, it is a valuable tool for developers to learn in order to effectively collaborate on software development projects. Second, it helps developers learn and practice important skills such as version control, code review, and project management. Third, GitHub is a popular platform used by many organizations, and knowing how to use it can be an asset for anyone pursuing a career in software development. Finally, by contributing to open-source projects hosted on GitHub, developers can learn from others, gain recognition, and improve their skills. Overall, learning how to use GitHub is an important step for anyone interested in software development or collaborative project management.
